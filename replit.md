- **Database**: Environment-based connection via `DATABASE_URL`

### Production Build
1. Frontend: Vite builds optimized React app to `/dist/public`
2. Backend: ESBuild bundles Express server to `/dist/index.js`
3. Assets: Static files served from built directory
4. Database: Drizzle migrations run via `npm run db:push`

### Environment Setup
- **Node.js**: ES modules with TypeScript compilation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection string required
- **Static Assets**: Served from `/dist/public` in production
- **API Routes**: All backend routes prefixed with `/api`

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript definitions, enabling type safety across the full stack while maintaining clear separation between frontend and backend concerns.
