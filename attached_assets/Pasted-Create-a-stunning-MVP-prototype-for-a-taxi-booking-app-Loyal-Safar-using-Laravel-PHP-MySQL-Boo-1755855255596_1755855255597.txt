Create a stunning MVP prototype for a taxi booking app (Loyal Safar) using Laravel (PHP), MySQL, Bootstrap, and jQuery. This MVP must include all core modules from the provided PDF and the enhanced features I outlined below.
🔹 Technology Stack (must use)
Backend: PHP (Laravel)
Frontend: Bootstrap 5 + jQuery + Swiper/Flickity for UI
Database: MySQL (Laravel Eloquent ORM)
Server: Apache (Ubuntu)
Real-time: Firebase / Pusher / Socket.IO (for live ride tracking)
🔹 Database Schema (as per PDF + strategy)
1. Driver Commission Model
areas (id, name)
commission_slabs (id, area_id, min_fare, max_fare, commission_type, commission_value, is_default, active)
rides (id, user_id, driver_id, area_id, total_fare, commission_amount, commission_type, driver_payout, coupon_code, coupon_discount, final_fare, payment_status, ride_status)
Logic:
On ride completion → check fare range → apply slab rule → calculate commission → auto-credit driver payout.
If no slab → apply default slab.
2. Ride Tracking + Share Feature
ride_sessions (id, ride_id, token, start_time, end_time, active)
ride_shares (id, ride_id, shared_with, share_time, status)
Logic:
OTP verification → session starts.
Rider can share tracking via WhatsApp, SMS, contact, or copy link.
Shared link shows live driver location, masked number, ETA.
Session auto-expires after ride.
3. Coupon + Driver Payout Model
driver_wallets (id, driver_id, ride_id, amount, transaction_type, reason, source, created_at)
coupon_redemptions (id, user_id, ride_id, coupon_code, discount_amount, covered_by, created_at)
company_wallets (id, ride_id, driver_id, amount, transaction_type, reason, created_at)
Logic:
User applies coupon → discount applied from company funds.
Driver always receives full fare in wallet.
Company ledger absorbs coupon discount.
Reports must show: coupon usage, wallet debits, payouts.
🔹 Enhanced Features (beyond PDF)
Instant UPI Payouts for drivers → integrate RazorpayX or Cashfree API.
Multi-language support (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, English).
Rider Loyalty Program → users earn points per ride, redeemable for discounts.
Driver Community Section → forum/chat + leaderboard with incentives.
Panic Button → sends SMS/WhatsApp alert to emergency contacts with live ride link.
Tier-2/Tier-3 Optimization → offline booking mode + UPI-first payment focus.
Eco-friendly Toggle → “Green Ride” option for EVs or shared rides with CO₂ tracker.
🔹 Prototype Scope (Deliverables)
Admin Panel (Bootstrap + Laravel Blade):
Manage commission slabs
Manage coupons
View reports (driver payouts, company wallet debits, coupon usage, shared ride logs)
Rider App (Prototype UI):
Ride booking form
Coupon apply option
OTP verification → Start ride → Share ride link (WhatsApp/SMS/Contact)
Panic button + live tracking page
Driver App (Prototype UI):
Wallet with instant payout view
Leaderboard + rewards/incentives section
Ride completion → auto-calculated commission & payout
Database Seeding (Dummy Data):
Example drivers, riders, rides, areas (Kolkata, Howrah)
Example commission slabs (fixed/percentage)
Example coupons
Example ride session sharing links
🔹 UI/UX Requirements
Bootstrap 5 modern UI → clean, mobile-first, fast-loading.
Use Swiper/Flickity for ride booking carousel.
Use Fancybox for ride receipt & tracking popups.
Simple but professional branding (blue/green theme for eco-friendly trust).
🔹 Expected Output
Fully functional Laravel project (MVP prototype).
Pre-configured MySQL migrations for all tables.
Blade templates for Admin, Rider, Driver dashboards.
Dummy data + seeded rides to demonstrate commission slabs, coupon use, live ride sharing.
Documentation (README.md) explaining setup + demo credentials.
⚡ Build this as a stunning MVP that can be shown directly to investors or the business owner to demonstrate how Loyal Safar can outsmart Uber/Ola in India.
